**Notes to marker about TEST CLASSES**

*Please note that all the tests in test classes work when test classes are run INDIVIDUALLY. 
But NOT when the test classes are all run together, due to the static variables that are increasing.

*So when testing the test classes please run them SEPERATELY to ensure all tests are correctly run as intended.

Thanks.
